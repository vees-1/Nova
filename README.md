## 🔹 Executive Summary

**MERCURY** is a **low-latency, hybrid recommendation system** built to solve one of the hardest real-world machine learning problems:  

Cold-start users and products in ecommerce.

Traditional collaborative filtering systems collapse when historical interaction data is missing.  
MERCURY avoids this failure mode by using a Two-Tower Neural Network to generate semantic embeddings from item metadata and user context, enabling relevant recommendations from the very first interaction.

The system is intentionally designed to run on zero-cost infrastructure using open-source tools—prioritizing scalability, reproducibility, and vendor independence.
